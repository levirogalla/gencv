issue with selecting points, maybe re do entire algorithm

[experience_order, experience_similarity, experience_id, ]

first sort the experiences by they're fixed order if given,
then sort by their similarity,
in the case where to experiences have the same similarity add an extra sort by experience_id, which won't do anything if theyre already grouped together
then sort the bullets by their fixed order,
then by the bullets similarity if know order is given,
then by group,
then by order in group
